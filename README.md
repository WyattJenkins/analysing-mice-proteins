# analysing-mice-proteins
We analyse how 77 different protein expressions vary across 8 different classes of mice. First, we clean the data, then do some data exploration and, finally, use some data modelling techniques such as decision tree classification and k-nearest neighbour classification.

- Start by downloading the Mice Protein Expression Data Set from (otherwise, this repository contains a copy of the original dataset): 
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression

- Ensure that the downloaded file is called Data_Cortex_Nuclear with the .xls extension.

- Make sure the .xls file is in the same directory as the .ipynb file.

- Open the PDS_A2.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda.

- Go to: Kernel -> Restart & Run All

- The code will run and all outputs will be displayed.
